# GitHub Search

Find all kinds of information about any user on GitHub using GitHub Search!

Written in Next JS and Typescript using GitHub API.

## Note

This project was something that wrote back in the day, with very basic skills and using CRA. One year later, I learnt a lot regarding the latest technologies, best practises. So I decided to visit back this project, and migrate it to use all the best practices I have learnt and most importantly - TypeScript and Next JS!

## Installation:

1. Install node js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install yarn by writing `npm i -g yarn` in your terminal ( might have to include `sudo` at the beginning if on Linux or Mac ).
3. Clone this repo and run the command `yarn install` to download all the necessary packages.
4. Run `yarn dev`.
